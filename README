# EzBake Common Libraries for NodeJS

This repo contains all of the core EzBake libraries for NodeJS. Essentially everything that is needed
to write an application for EzBake.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo

```
git clone <repo url> ezbake-common-nodejs
cd ezbake-common-nodejs
```

The layout of the directories follows a logical structure: configuration, discovery, thrift-utils, etc. Typically, each
sub directory is it's own python package.

### Dependencies

- NodeJS ~ 0.10.x
- npm ~ 2.x

### Configuring npm for Artifactory

We use an Artifactory npm repo for EzBake. The artifactory repo mirrors npmjs.org, so it is safe to configure as the
global npm repository. The following steps will write the necessary configuration files, including user credentials.

```
# replace '<artifactory base url>', '<USERNAME>', and '<PASSWORD>' with your artifactory credentials
export ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL=<artifactory base url>
export ARTIFACTORY_USER=<USERNAME>
export ARTIFACTORY_PASS=<PASSWORD>

npm config set registry https://${ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL}/artifactory/api/npm/npm
cp ~/.npmrc ~/.npmrc.bak
curl -u "${ARTIFACTORY_USER}:${ARTIFACTORY_PASS}" https://${ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL}/artifactory/api/npm/auth >> ~/.npmrc

```

Existing configurations are saved in .bak files before being overwritten.

### Installing packages

Each sub project contains a package.json file that can be used in conjunction with npm to install dependencies

```
npm install
```

If you find yourself needing to install a specific EzBake dependency, that can be installed with npm as well

```
npm install ezbake-configuration

### Publishing packages

__NOTE__: These steps are outlined for reference, and should only be performed by team leads. In the future publishing
to the npm repo will be performed by Jenkins.

On the command line:

```
npm publish --registry https://${ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL}/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local
```

In package.json:

```
"publishConfig":{
  "registry":"https://${ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL}/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local"
}

```
